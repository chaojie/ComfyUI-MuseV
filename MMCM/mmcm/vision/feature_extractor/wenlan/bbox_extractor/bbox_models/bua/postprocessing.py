    Resize the output instances.
    The input images are often resized when entering an object detector.
    As a result, we often need the outputs of the detector in a different
    resolution from its inputs.

    This function will resize the raw outputs of an R-CNN detector
    to produce outputs according to the desired output resolution.

    Args:
        results (Instances): the raw outputs from the detector.
            `results.image_size` contains the input image resolution the detector sees.
            This object might be modified in-place.
        output_height, output_width: the desired output resolution.

    Returns:
        Instances: the resized output from the model, based on the output resolution
